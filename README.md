## Game Rules

- The game field is represented as a grid. Each cell can be one of the following:
  - `*` represents the player's current position.
  - `^` represents the hat. The goal is to reach this cell.
  - `O` represents a hole. If the player moves into a hole, they lose.
  - `â–‘` represents open field. The player can safely move into these cells.

- The player starts at the top-left corner of the field and can move one cell at a time in any of the four directions (up, down, left, or right).

- The game ends when the player either finds the hat (and wins) or falls into a hole (and loses).
